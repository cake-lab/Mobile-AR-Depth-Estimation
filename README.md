For running DistDepth we didn't provide any notebook you can just simply follow there instructures in the readme in here [Readme.md](models/DistDepth/README.md) and you can also download the pre-trained weights from the link provided in the readme. and just simply run this command.

```bash
sh eval.sh
```

just make sure you have the pre-trained weights in the same directory as the eval.sh file.

after running this command you will get evaluation results of the model on ARKit dataset.
